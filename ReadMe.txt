#### In this notebook I'm analysising Kiva Dataset. 
Kiva.org is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services 
to  poor and financially excluded people around the world.
 Kiva lenders have provided over 1 billion dollars in loans to over 
2 million people. In order to set investment priorities,
